    # Not sure yet how we want to create new dates. If we want all dates for the rest of the month, year, etc. populated. If we want to make sure we have dates for the farthest out task date or what... but probably this isn't a front end task. I can only see the front end needing to change the special_date and special_date_desc to add any holidays, vacations, etc.
